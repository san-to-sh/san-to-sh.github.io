![Hello]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/profile_optimized.jpg){: width="300" style="border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px;"}

I'm a data science professional in Chicago who loves tech, fitness, and pretending to be a minimalist while debugging overly complex data pipelines.

When I'm not wrangling data or building apps that definitely won't crash (probably), you'll find me running along Lake Michigan, listening to podcasts like I'm training for a TED Talk, or exploring every vegan/vegetarian café in the city like it's a side quest. I also tend to pick up hobbies the way most people collect streaming services—recent obsessions include pickleball and golf, and I'm hoping to add skiing to the mix this winter.

I'm into CrossFit, yoga, stand-up comedy, and travel.
And I will die on this hill: Pancakes > Waffles. Mountains > Beaches. Don't @ me.
