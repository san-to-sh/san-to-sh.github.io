![Hello]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/profile_optimized.jpg){: width="300" style="border-radius: 8px; margin-bottom: 20px;"}

I'm a data science professional in Chicago who loves tech, fitness, and pretending to be a minimalist while debugging overly complex data pipelines.

When I'm not wrangling data or building apps that definitely won't crash (probably), you'll find me running along Lake Michigan, listening to podcasts like I'm training for a TED Talk, or trying every vegan/vegetarian cafÃ© in the city like it's a side quest.

I'm into CrossFit, yoga, stand-up comedy, and travel. And I will die on this hill: Pancakes > Waffles. Don't @ me.
