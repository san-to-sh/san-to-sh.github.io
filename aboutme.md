I'm a data science professional based out of Chicago. I'm passionate about tech, fitness and entrepreneurship.

When I'm not solving data problems / building data apps you will find me running along Lake Michigan while listening to podcasts and exploring new vegan/vegatarian cafes and restraunts in the city.

Other interests include crossfit, yoga, stand up comedy and traveling. I will die on this hill : Pancakes > Waffles :)
